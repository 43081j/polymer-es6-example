# \<polymer-es6-example\>

ES6 example of a Polymer app

Essentially this is a very brief example of how to setup a build process using [polymer-build](https://github.com/polymer/polymer-build) combined with babel.

This means you can write your elements as classes which extend the native `HTMLElement` and have them transpiled by babel.

## Install

```
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ gulp
```

## Viewing

```

```

## Building
